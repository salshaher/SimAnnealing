# SimAnnealing

MATLAB and Java solutions to an optimization problem using 
simulated annealing program to maximize the function: f (x) = x3 - 90x2 + 600x + 100. 
Given that the solution is a 6-bit binary number and the initial solution has the value 18.
The neighbor must be generated by flipping a random bit of the current solution, and the
cooling function is given as: T=0.9(T). It was required to run the final code for two scenarios
each having a different initial value of the temperature: T1=550 and T2=150.
